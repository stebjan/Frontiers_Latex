%As a primary goal, the abstract should render the general significance and conceptual advance of the work clearly accessible to a broad readership. References should not be cited in the abstract.
Neuroinformatics laboratories produce a lot of experimental data, which have to be stored and further processed. Storing and sharing data among laboratories is usual; however, sharing analytic methods is still not satisfactorily solved. The methods are usually accessible for users only via web browsers or downloadable and locally installable applications (e.g. EEGLAB). This paper presents a new approach of sharing analytic methods in the electrophysiology domain consisting in implementation of methods as Web Services. The proposed approach allows sharing of methods to third parties by integration the Web Services client into another application. The results demonstrate the implementation of this sharing technique to the EEG Data processor and the integration of methods into the EEG/ERP Portal.

\section{Introduction}

% For Original Research Articles, Clinical Trial Articles, and Technology Reports the introduction should be succinct, with no subheadings.
%
% For Clinical Case Studies the Introduction should include symptoms at presentation, physical exams and lab results.
%
Our research group specializes in the research of brain electrical activity and development of corresponding hardware and software infrastructure. The conducted experiments usually take long time and produce vast collections of data. To measure and analyse these data, we widely use the techniques and methods of electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potentials (ERP). This article focuses on the analytic methods used in electrophysiology and their effective sharing.

Sharing experimental data and/or processing algorithms is very helpful for scientific community since individual researchers can more focus on their field of expertise. Then experimentalists can use e.g. the shared data formats or software infrastructure to manage their data while experts in data processing are not required produce their own data and can apply processing methods and workflows on the data shared by experimentalists. Data to be further interpretable must be very well documented by suitable metadata~\cite{Tetters08} and the sharing of data has to be then accompanied by shared metadata formats and widely accepted metadata terminology. In our group we took over the metadata format and terminology proposed and developed by German INCF Node. This solution is used in our custom solution – the EEG/ERP Portal~\cite{Jezek10}. Currently we are working on the adoption of standardized format for electrophysiological data that should replace the contemporary practice, storing data as they are acquired from the used softare tools, it means in proprietary format.  Except sharing of data and metadata we have also focused on design, implementation and sharing of analytic algorithms suitable for electrophysiological experiments. As a result we have developed an analytic tools management system – the EEG Data Processor~\cite{Jezek13}.

Currently, analytic methods are usually used within a software infrastructure for electrophysiological data processing or as an integrated part of a~portal solution (as presented on examples in the State of the Art section). Then scientists are able to use these methods locally or within a portal solution via a~web user interface. When using a~web interface the main disadvantage is the necessity of uploading data into a~web portal data storage, it could be demanding because of overall data size, but also the loss of control over the data physical storage could be an unpleasant issue for some researchers. When using a~software solution for analytic methods that is technologically different from the data storage there are also difficulties with the integration of these methods into a different, third-party application. However, such integration would be very helpful since complex solutions including data management and data processing for shared data are very rare. In this paper, we present a~new approach of sharing analytic methods in the electrophysiological domain with applications developed by third parties. The consequently presented use case allows users the integration of their analytic methods into the EEG Data Processor and their remote running.

This paper also discusses the importance of sharing analytic methods (algorithms) in electrophysiology for the scientific community. It brings a~brief introduction to existing software infrastructures allowing storing and sharing data and using analytic methods on them. The used approach for sharing data and methods is described. Then the approach of sharing analytic methods with third parties and its implementation is presented. The last section of the paper shows the integration of the EEG Data Processor methods into the EEG/ERP Portal that serves as a~data management tool. This integration allows users of the EEG/ERP Portal executing the methods directly in the Portal where their experimental data are stored. It means that the Portal users are not required to download their data from the Portal and upload them to the EEG Data Processor~\cite{Jezek13} to proceed their data (see Section 2.2).

\subsection{State of the Art}
There is a growing community of theorists in neuroscience who are trained in development and proper usage of analytic methods but having no direct access to experimental data. Therefore, they created mathematical models that were not guided by data and often only of limited relevance to neuroscience. Data sharing allowed theorists testing developed methods on real data~\cite{Tetters08}. There is also a community of experimentalists that obtain data but have limited access to analytic methods. Sharing of methods allows them analysing and validating their data. The following paragraphs bring an overview of existing contributions dealing with providing and sharing experimental data and/or analytic methods.

The CARMEN Portal~\cite{Watson07} (Code Analysis, Repository \& Modelling for e-Neuroscience) developed by the British National Node allows neuroscientists to save and share both experimental data and services. Collaborators can upload and share experimental data and they can also upload their analytic tools as web services and share them since a~storage for services is also provided. There are number of public services such as data filters, neural spike detection and spike sorting methods. All analytic tools are accessible for registered users via the CARMEN Portal and can be run on the stored data that a~user has access to. Each service belongs to its owner who uploaded it to the CARMEN Portal. When a~scientist wants to use a CARMEN service anywhere else, he/she has to contact an owner of the service.

The Galaxy project~\cite{goecks2010galaxy, blankenberg2010galaxy, giardine2005galaxy}, focused on genome analysis, is an open source workflows engine. Only a~registered user is able to use methods and workflow tools provided by this system. However, only administrators or developers can add their own methods suitable for genome analysis. The methods and their parameters, complemented with examples, are well described. Theoretically, the methods implemented as Web Services could support remote integration. However, currently there is no support for calling remote methods by external applications.

Modular Toolkit for Data Processing (MDP)~\cite{Zito08} is a~modular data processing framework written in Python that is used for scientific data processing development. From the user’s perspective, MDP consists of a~collection of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, e.g. Principal Component Analysis, several Independent Component Analysis algorithms (CuBICA, FastICA, TDSEP, and JADE), or Locally Linear Embedding. Common users can call implemented modules locally. Processing flows can be created and executed. The framework itself can be extended by additional modules~\cite{MDP12}.

EEGLAB~\cite{Delorme04} and ERPLAB are MATLAB toolboxes for EEG and ERP (event related potentials) signal analysis enriched with a~graphic user interface (GUI). Data are imported for processing via GUI from a~local storage. Available functions include import of EEG data, channel and event information, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial ERP-image plots), preprocessing (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and time-frequency decompositions. A 'plug-in' facility allows easy incorporation of new EEG modules into the main menu. EEGLAB (and also ERPLAB) is freely available (http://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) under the GNU public license for non-commercial use and open source development, together with sample data, user tutorial and extensive documentation.

The software and hardware infrastructure developed by the German Neuroinformatics Node (G-Node)~\cite{Herz08, GNode} eases the acquisition, storage and analysis of experimental data. G-Node focuses on cellular and systems neurophysiology and provides various services and tools to facilitate data access and data management (Neuroshare \cite{Neuroshare} to HDF5 converter, etc.). They have been developing a~Rest API to enable easy access to shared data from different applications~\cite{Sobolev14}. The G-Node portal is open source; the source code including analytic tools is available on GitHub (https://github.com/G-Node).

Taverna [], created within the myGrid project, is an open source domain independent scientific workflow management application that allows designing, sharing and executing workflows. It allows users to integrate many different software components, including SOAP/REST web services, or command tools. Taverna can access a large number of services e.g. in bioinformatics, astronomy, chemoinformatics, or health informatics. A~set of available tools include Taverna Workbench (a~toolbox with GUI for local installation), Taverna Online web based tool for authoring workflows; Taverna Server and client that allow Taverna workflows to be run on other machines.

The overview presented in Table 1 shows ability of the introduced frameworks and tools to share data and especially provide and share methods to end users (by using them via web portal or installing a stand-alone system containing methods locally). The table also shows lack of support for integration of the methods into external applications developed by third parties. Since such solution of methods sharing would be very helpful, we present this approach in the following text.

\subsection{EEG Data Processor}

EEG Data Processor~\cite{Jezek13} developed by our research group is a~web application for running EEG/ERP signal processing methods. It contains the following methods for EEG/ERP signal analysis: Matching Pursuit~\cite{Vareka12}, Discrete and Continuous Wavelet transform~\cite{Ciniburk10}, FastICA~\cite{Hyv01}, and Fast Fourier transform~\cite{FFT}. It enables users upload and analyse data, process them, and download the processing results. The input data are stored  only temporarily. Each method is a~plug-in (a~JAR file) that is called by an external method invoker. The open source code of the EEG Data Processor including the analytic methods is freely available at the SourceForge repository (https://sourceforge.net/projects/eegprocessor/).

The system is designed as a~layered architecture. This architectural style is supported by used programming languages and technologies (Java, Maven, Spring, Hibernate, Apache CXF Web services etc.)~\cite{Jezek13}.

\subsection{Third-Party Sharing Approach}

The EEG Data Processor was extended to enable using its analytic methods directly by third-party applications. The concept consists in the registration of applications developed and run by third parties into the EEG Data Processor. When the application is registered and accepted by the administrator of the EEG Data Processor, it can use methods provided by the Processor. Figure 1 shows the communication between the EEG Data Processor and client application.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=18cm]{methods}% This is an *.eps file
\end{center}
\textbf{\refstepcounter{figure}\label{fig:01} Figure \arabic{figure}.}{ Communication between applications. }
\end{figure}

This approach removes the necessity of manual data transfer from a~registered third-party application to the EEG Data Processor. Since the methods are available and runnable from the client application directly, the data transfer is performed automatically. The proposed approach also solves the difficulties with the maintenance of the analytic methods. This solution thus provides an opportunity to call shared methods remotely from different applications independently of programming language and type of the client application. For successful integration a~client for remote methods call has to be implemented.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Third-Party Sharing Implementation}

This section presents the third-party sharing technique and its implementation in the EEG Data Processor. Since we use the Web Services technology for the implementation, this section also provides its brief description. We propose the third-party sharing mechanism implemented in the EEG Data Processor that extends the common sharing of methods and enables integration of the provided methods to other applications and using them there.

The proposed approach of sharing methods is based on Remote Procedure Call technique (RPC). RPC is widely used for constructing distributed, client-server based applications. A client application calls a remote procedure (method), transfers data to a server application, and waits for a result. For web applications Web Services technology \cite{Liu06} is used. For implementation of this approach, the SOAP Web Services technology is used. SOAP Web Services \cite{Liu06} use XML messages, HTTP protocol, and XML Namespaces for objects identification.

The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a lightweight, XML-based protocol for exchanging information in a decentralized, distributed environment. SOAP-based requests and responses are combined with a transport protocol, such as HTTP \cite{WS}. The main advantage of SOAP is protocol, language, and platform independence \cite{WS}.
The Remote Procedure Call technique is used in the EEG Data Processor for third-party sharing of the analytic methods. The EEG Data Processor provides a following set of features.

\begin{itemize}
\item List of available methods – This method returns the list of available signal processing method provided by the EEG Data Processor.
\item List of parameters of chosen method – It returns required parameters of selected method with data type and restrictions (possible values etc.).
\item Running the selected method – Result of selected analytic method is provided in XML format.
\item Number of available threads – It returns information about available processing threads. If there is no available thread, a request is put into a queue.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Registration}

When users want to use the EEG Data Processor, they also have to register first by filling the simple registration form (including full name of user, his/her email and password). The successful registration grants access to the EEG Data Processor and its analytic methods to users.

In case of any uncommon or violent behaviour of a registered user, administrators of the Processor are able to block the user.

As we mentioned before, we implemented the third-party sharing mechanism allowing using presented methods in other applications. A registered user is able to register his/her application via registration form (Figure 2). The fields name of application and password will be used as credentials for the Web Services client. The site URL field is used for checking a newly registered application by the EEG Data Processor administrators. There are defined several statuses for applications.

\end{center}
\textbf{\refstepcounter{figure}\label{fig:02} Figure \arabic{figure}.}{The form for registration of application }
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item Pending – It is a status for newly registered application before review. This application is not able to use the analytic methods.
\item Rejected – The registered application is rejected by a reviewer.
\item Confirmed – The registered application is accepted by a reviewer and is able to use the analytic methods.
\item Blocked – administrators of the EEG Data Processor are able to block an application when any uncommon or violent behaviour is discovered.

\end{itemize}

Administrators are able to change a status of an application via administration of applications interface (Figure 3). Confirmed applications are able to integrate the analytic methods by implementation of a Web Services client. The EEG Data Processor serves as a Web Services server.

\textbf{\refstepcounter{figure}\label{fig:03} Figure \arabic{figure}.}{Administration of applications }
\end{figure}

\subsection{Integration with the EEG/ERP Portal}

This section describes integration of the analytic methods provided by the EEG Data Processor into the EEG/ERP Portal. It mainly provides the technical information about used technology and the implementation of Web Services in the EEG Data Processor and the WS client in the EEG/ERP Portal. The EEG/ERP Portal is already registered in the Processor and confirmed.

The EEG/ERP Portal has been developed by our research group \cite{Jezek10}. This portal enables research groups to store, manage and download their experimental data and metadata. The portal is developed as a standalone product running on servers in our department. The usage of the Portal does not require any special software installation, only a web browser.

Apache CXF \cite{CXF} is an open source services framework that makes web service development easy, simplified, and standard based. This technology is used for client-server based integration of web applications. The client application will prepare an order and send it to the EEG Data Processor through a business method call. For implementation we use code-first approach. It includes three following steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item Create a Service Endpoint Interface (SEI) and define a business method to be used with the web service.
\item Create the implementation class and annotate it as a web service.
\item Create an xml configuration of the service class and an instance of the class using JAX-WS frontend.

\end{itemize}

We have created the Service Endpoint Interface with defined methods allowing accessing and running analytic methods, which the EEG Data Processor provides. This interface is given below.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
@WebService
@Secured("ROLE_APP")
public interface ProcessService{
/**
* Getter of available algorithm names.
* @return algorithm names
*/
public String[] getAvailableMethods();
/**
* Returns number of currently available processing units.
* @return available processing units
*/
public int availableProcessingUnits();
/**
* Getter of parameters necessary for method to run.
* @param fileFormat supported file format
* @param methodName name of desired process method
* @return array of parameters of chosen method
*/
public MethodParameters[] getMethodParameters(SupportedFormat fileFormat,
String methodName);
/**
* Returns byte array of processed data
* (will be replaced by output format in time)
* @param data files to be processed
* @param fileFormat one of supported file formats
* @param algorithmName name of processing algorithm
* @param params other parameters
* @return bytes of processed data
*/
public byte[] processData(DataFile[] data, SupportedFormat fileFormat,
String methodName, String[] params);
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

For integration of the service into a client application (e.g. the EEG/ERP Portal), it is necessary to configure the Web Services client. The client configuration in the EEG/ERP Portal using the Apache CXF is given below. Id specifies a unique identifier for the client instance. Address specifies the URL address where the endpoint of the service is published. ServiceClass specifies the interface of the service in the client application. In the EEG/ERP Portal, we used the Apache CXF for generating necessary files for the client implementation from the description file .wsdl.

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
<jaxws:client id="eegService" address="http://147.228.63.134:8080/
eegdataprocessor/webservice/ webservice/processService"
serviceClass="cz.zcu.kiv.eegdatabase.webservices.EDPClient.ProcessService"
username="EEGBase"
password="***********" />
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

When the client is configured, the interface shown above is available to use in the client application. In the EEG/ERP Portal, we use it as follows: The getAvailableMethods gets all available methods from the EEG Data Processor. Then a user selects method and data. The required parameters of the selected method are obtained by getMethodParameters method. When all parameters are filled, the method processData starts data processing.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=16cm]{portal01}% This is an *.eps file
\end{center}
\textbf{\refstepcounter{figure}\label{fig:04} Figure \arabic{figure}.}{Integration of methods into the EEG/ERP Portal }
\end{figure}

For users of the EEG/ERP Portal, we have prepared a web interface, where he/she select an experiment including data and chooses services option. The EEG/ERP Portal displays available methods and data (Figure 4). The next web page includes form where a user fills parameters of selected method. The Run button starts the processing. The EEG/ERP Portal waits for processing result on background, so a user can continue to work. When finished, the processing result is stored as XML file into the database for further using. A user can obtain results using Services Results button in Experiment section (Figure 5).

\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}

This paper summarizes basic approaches of sharing analytic methods. The common approach is to publish methods via a portal or a web interface. Users upload data on the server and are able to use a method. We extended this approach by allowing third-party sharing of our methods.

We implemented our methods as web services via Web Services technology. Then we published the web services description file (.wsdl). Once a user registers his/her application in the EEG Data Processor, the methods can be integrated into this application. The methods are still accessible via the web interface for registered users.

Since the wsdl description file and also communication between client and server are based on XML language, the Web services technology brings the language independency. Methods and also the EEG Data Processor are implemented in the Java language; however, client applications can be implemented in different programming language.

The main disadvantage of this approach is the necessity to modify the client application. Developers have to create the WS client and put it into the application. However, there are possibilities to generate the WS client automatically from the wsdl file. The widely used tools are wsdl2Java \cite{WSDL2Java}, Web Services Description Language Tool for Java or C\#, or SOAPy for Python. When a client is implemented, it automatically reacts on changing (adding, editing, or removing) methods in the EEG Data Processor.

We successfully integrated the methods from the EEG Data Processor into the EEG/ERP Portal. This integration allows us using the methods directly in the Portal. This integration is described in Section 3.3.

Currently, the EEG Data Processor allows addition of methods developed in Java language. Therefore, our future work includes the development of advanced plug-in engine for automatic addition of analytic methods in different programming languages (Java, Python, Matlab).
